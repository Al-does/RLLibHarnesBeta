# Multi-repo workflow

## Entry point

Colleagues start at
[`rl-experiments`](https://github.com/Al-does/rl-experiments):

1. **Fork** it (keeps the name `rl-experiments` — no rename).
2. Clone their fork.
3. Run `./scripts/bootstrap_local.sh` — clones
   [`rl-harness`](https://github.com/Al-does/RL-Harness) beside it if needed
   and editable-installs the library.
4. Replace the example study with their science.

The shared library is this repository (`rl-harness`). Personal science stays on
each researcher's fork of `rl-experiments`.

## Repos

| Repo | Role |
|---|---|
| [`rl-experiments`](https://github.com/Al-does/rl-experiments) | **Headline entry point** — fork this |
| [`RL-Harness`](https://github.com/Al-does/RL-Harness) | Shared library — PRs for reusable code |
| Personal forks / repos (e.g. `alex-rl-experiments`) | Ongoing science histories |

## Default local layout

```text
parent/
  rl-harness/        # shared library (cloned by bootstrap if missing)
  rl-experiments/    # your fork
```

Experiment repos declare an editable path dependency:

```toml
[tool.uv.sources]
rl-harness = { path = "../rl-harness", editable = true }
```

Until the API stabilizes, everyone tracks library `main` (pull often). Run
manifests record the library commit SHA (and package version later).

## Who commits where

| Change | Repository | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `experiment.py`, findings, compact results | your fork of `rl-experiments` | push to your fork (not a science PR upstream) |
| `harness/`, `learners/`, `losses/`, `envs/`, `analysis/`, `devops/` | `rl-harness` | branch + PR |
| Improvements to the starter itself | upstream `rl-experiments` | optional small PR |

A change that touches library + science requires **two commits** (one per repo).

## Why fork (not rename / not “Use this template”)

- Fork keeps the folder and repo name `rl-experiments` for everyone.
- No “clone then rename my-jane-experiments” step.
- Science stays on the researcher’s GitHub account; library contributions still
  go to `rl-harness` via normal PRs.

## Agent worktree isolation

Concurrent Cursor agents on one machine can silently change a shared checkout's
`HEAD` when the agent root moves between sibling clones. Before any mutating
git command (`cherry-pick`, `commit`, `push`, result import), assert the
expected branch:

```python
from pathlib import Path

from devops.git.branch_guard import assert_branch

assert_branch(
    Path("..") / "rl-experiments",
    "experiment/mess3-paper-replication",
    operation="cherry-pick origin/results",
)
```

Prefer one git worktree (or one agent session) per concurrent task so branch
metadata in the UI cannot race with another session's checkout.

Boxes clone the experiment fork (results push target) and this library as
siblings, then `uv sync` in the experiment repo. Point provisioning at *your*
fork’s URL. See `devops/vast/README.md`.
